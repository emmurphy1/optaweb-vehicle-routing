= Run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing
After you download OptaWeb Vehicle Routing, use the `run.sh` script to run it.

.Prerequisites
* Internet access is available. When OptaWeb Vehicle Routing runs it uses third-party public services such as link:https://www.openstreetmap.org/about[OpenStreetMap]
to display map tiles and provide search results.
* Java 8 or higher is installed.
* A data directory with at least one OSM file exists.
* A country code to use in search queries is identified.


.Procedure
Enter the following command, where `<COUNTRY>` is the country that you downloaded data for and `<CODE>` is the code for that country:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run.sh ~/.vrp/ <COUNTRY>-latest.osm.pbf <CODE>
----

For example, if you want to run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing with Belgium and you  downloaded the `belgium-latest.osm.pbf` from the Geofabrik web site, enter the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run.sh ~/.vrp/ belgium-latest.osm.pbf BE
