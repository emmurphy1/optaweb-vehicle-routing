= Download routing data

The routing engine requires geographical data to calculate the time it takes vehicles to travel between locations. You must download and store OSM (OpenStreetMap) data files on the local file system before you run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing.

NOTE: The OSM data files are typically between 100 MB to 1 GB and take time to download so it is a good idea to download the files before building or starting the OptaWeb Vehicle Routing application.

.Procedure
. Open http://download.geofabrik.de/ in a web browser.
. Click a region in the *Sub Region* list, for example *Europe*. The sub region's page opens.
. In the *Sub Regions* table, download the OSM file (`.osm.pbf`) for a country, for example Belgium.
