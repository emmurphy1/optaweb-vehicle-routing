= Run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing locally using the runLocally.sh script

Linux and macOS users can use the `runLocally.sh` Bash script to run OptaWeb Vehicle Routing. The script automates the following setup steps that would otherwise have to be carried out manually:

* Create the data directory.
* Download selected OpenStreetMap (OSM) files from Geofabrik.
* Try to associate a country code with each downloaded OSM file automatically.
* Build the project if the standalone JAR file does not exist.
* Launch OptaWeb Vehicle Routing by taking a single region argument or by selecting the region interactively.

You can run the `runLocally.sh` script in the following ways:

* Quick start mode
* Interactive mode
* Non-interactive mode
* Air distance mode
