You can use the interactive mode to download additional OSM files from Geofabrik without visiting the website and choosing a destination for the download.

.Prerequisites
* `optaweb-vehicle-routing` repository is cloned on your computer.
* Internet access is available.
* Java 8 or higher is installed.

.Procedure
. Change directory to the `optaweb-vehicle-routing-distribution-{VRPVERSIONLONG}.Final/bin` directory.
. Enter the following command to run the script in interactive mode:

COMMENT:How do I know a region's ID? Is there a list?
. Repeat the previous step until you see a list with the region you want to download.

[WARNING]
.Using large OSM files
====
For the best user experience, use smaller regions such as individual European or US states.
Using OSM files larger than 1 GB will require significant RAM size and take a lot of time (up to several hours) for the initial processing.
